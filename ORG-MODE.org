#+title: A Few Words About Org Mode
#+date: 2024-07-12

*  Introduction

   This is a simple document to test how [[https://github.com/][GitHub]] renders [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]
   documents into HTML.  I have to admit, I'm not a great fan of
   HTML.  But I suppose it could be worse.  It was worse in the
   1990s, so I'll cope.

   ** Can Second-Level Headlines Be Indented?

   It would be nice if I could indent second level section
   headers, but I don't think I can.

** This Is A Second, Second-Level Headline

   It looks weird to not have a second subordinate section once
   you've created the first.

* Some Example Blocks

   This is supposed to be a code example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (defun
      org-xor
      (a b)
      "Exclusive or."
      (if a (not b) b))
   #+END_SRC

   And here's a table:

   | Name | Ph # | Age |
   |------+------+-----|
   | Pete | 1234 |  17 |
   | Anna | 4321 |  25 |

   | One                | Two     | Three                 |
   |--------------------+---------+-----------------------|
   | This is            | a       | test                  |
   | And                | here is | another               |
   | it would be        | cool if | emacs would           |
   | automatically fill | the     | entire line with text |
