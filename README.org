   A Few Things I've Learned About GIT
  
   I've used GIT for more years than I would like to admit.  Before
   that  I used  Mercurial, Subversion,  CVS, Perforce,  ClearCase,
   PVCS, RCS and SCCS.  So I've  seen a few version control sins in
   my time.  I wanted to write  down a few thoughts about using GIT
   and what better place than in text files in a GIT repo?
   
   Content in this repo is divided into these sections:
     
   1. [[./1_CONCEPTUAL.org][Conceptual Discussions About GIT and Version Control]]
      
   2. [[./2_MISTAKES.org][Recovering From Mistakes]]

   3. [[./3_UNDER_THE_HOOD.org][Under the Hood]]
