   A Few Things I've Learned About GIT
  
   I've used GIT for more years than I would like to admit.  Before
   that  I used  Mercurial, Subversion,  CVS, Perforce,  ClearCase,
   PVCS, RCS and SCCS.  So I've  seen a few version control sins in
   my time.  I wanted to write  down a few thoughts about using GIT
   and what better place than in text files in a GIT repo?
